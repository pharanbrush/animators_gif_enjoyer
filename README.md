- Fast, lightweight and instant-launch
- Scrub GIFs!
- Play and pause freely
- Use a focus range of frames to just scrub and loop a small part: great for long GIFs
- Copy a GIF frame to clipboard. (copies as PNG, which will preserve transparency in applications that support it, like Clip Studio Paint.)
- Pronounce GIF correctly!
- Drag and drop GIF files into the window.
- Paste GIF links to download it. (Embed links like from Tenor are not supported)
