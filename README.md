- Fast, lightweight and instant-launch
- Scrub GIFs!
- Play and pause freely
- Use a focus range of frames to just scrub and loop a small part: great for long GIFs
- Copy a GIF frame to clipboard. (copies as PNG, which will preserve transparency in applications that support it, like Clip Studio Paint and Discord.)
- Pronounce GIF correctly!
- Drag and drop GIF files into the window.
- Paste GIF links to download it. (Embed links like from Tenor are not supported)
- Quickly switch the interface brightness to check what the GIF looks like on different backgrounds.

### 1.0.13 (2025 Mar 6)
- Added option to make the frame slider fill the width of the window. (toggle this in the context menu or by middle-clicking the frame slider)
- Added "Open image sequence folder..."
- Fixed not being able to right-click in the empty area around a loaded gif to access the context menu.

### 1.0.8 (2023 Dec 19)
- Added option to remember window size.

### 1.0.7 (2023 Dec 1)
- Added option to allow multiple windows.
