Modified GIF handling library originally based on gif_view by Rafaelbarbosatec
See LICENSE file for more info.

- Fast, lightweight and instant-launch
- Scrub GIFs!
- Play and pause freely
- Use a focus range of frames to just scrub and loop a small part: great for long GIFs
- Copy a GIF frame to clipboard. (copies as PNG, which will preserve transparency in applications that support it, like Clip Studio Paint and Discord.)
- Pronounce GIF correctly!
- Drag and drop GIF files into the window.
- Paste GIF links to download it. (Embed links like from Tenor are not supported)

#### 1.0.4  
- Quickly switch the interface brightness to check what the GIF looks like on different backgrounds.

#### COMING SOON: 1.0.6  
- Change the playback speed.
- Zoom in. And then zoom some more. Maximum zoom out results in the size of a Discord inline emote (22px).
- Export GIF as a PNG Sequence (so you can use them in Blender or other apps that don't support GIFs).
